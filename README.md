This repository contains the code and dataset for the "Predicting Real Estate Prices in Mexico: A Linear Regression Model" data science project.

The project aims to build a linear regression model to predict real estate prices in Mexico using a publicly available dataset found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/properati-data/properties?select=properati-MX-2017-07-01-properties-sell.csv). The project includes the following files:

notebooks/price_prediction.ipynb - a Jupyter notebook containing the code for cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.

To run the project, first, create a virtual environment, then, run the Jupyter notebook.
